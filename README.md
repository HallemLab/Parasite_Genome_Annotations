# Parasite Genome Annotations
Community curated annotations for *Strongyloides* genomes (and potentially other parasitic nematode species), including those found on WormBase and WormBase ParaSite.

The current Hallem and Bryant Labs protocol for updating GFF annotations is available at [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16wsNDZPsc8jhPi4GMw8rxH2T7yzupwkVSpfGyFp2WCk/edit?usp=sharing).

## Species  
Species currently included in the community annotation efforts deposited in this repository.  

- *Strongyloides stercoralis*  
- *Strongyloides ratti*  

## Folders
- **GFF3s**: annotation files, including WormBase/ WormBase ParaSite annotationfiles and community annotation logs that are (potentially) not yet included in WBPS.
